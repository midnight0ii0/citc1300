        <h2>Origins and Tragedy</h2>
        <p>Kratos was once a mighty Spartan warrior who made a deal with Ares, the Greek God of War, in exchange for power. However, tricked by Ares, Kratos unknowingly slaughtered his own wife and daughter, leading to his eternal torment. This marked the beginning of his path to revenge.</p>
        
        <h2>Vengeance and Redemption</h2>
        <p>Fueled by rage, Kratos set out to destroy Ares and eventually became the new God of War. However, his bloodlust and defiance of the Olympian gods led him to a war against Zeus and Mount Olympus itself. After years of suffering, Kratos abandoned Greece and started a new life in the world of Norse mythology.</p>
        
        <h2>A New Beginning in Norse Mythology</h2>
        <p>In the Norse lands, Kratos found love again and fathered a son, Atreus. Following the death of his wife, Kratos embarks on a journey with Atreus to scatter her ashes. Throughout their adventure, they face powerful gods and creatures, while Kratos struggles to suppress his past and guide his son.</p>
